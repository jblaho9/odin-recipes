    <h2>What is "Bryndzové halušky?"</h2>
    <p>
      This is a <strong>Slovak</strong> national dish consisting of potato
      dumplings (halušky) mixed with a creamy, salty sheep's milk cheese
      (bryndza) and typically topped with crispy fried bacon bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish is a hearty and savory comfort food, with the tangy cheese
      coating the soft, doughy dumplings and the bacon adding a smoky, salty
      crunch.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients needed:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 500 g potatoes</li>
      <li>400 g all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>500 g bacon</li>
      <li>500 g bryndza (cheese)</li>
      <li>2 tbsps oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>

        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning
          occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon
          slices on paper towels. When bacon is cool, crumble and set aside.
        </p>

        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Place potatoes into a food processor and process until pureed, 2 to 3
          minutes. Transfer to a bowl and stir in flour, eggs, baking powder,
          and salt to make a sticky dough. Set dough aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Fill a large pot about half full of lightly salted water and bring to
          a boil. Ladle large spoonfuls of the sticky dough to a small cutting
          board and use a knife to chop the dough into tablespoon-size pieces;
          as you cut off a piece, drop it into the boiling water. Let the
          dumplings boil over medium heat until they float, 2 to 3 minutes.
          Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon to a large serving bowl.
        </p>

        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Sprinkle bacon crumbles and a handful of shredded brick cheese over
          each batch of dumplings; continue to make, boil, and transfer
          dumplings to the bowl, sprinkling each batch with bacon and brick
          cheese. When all dumplings are made, gently stir the haluski to mix
          all ingredients.
