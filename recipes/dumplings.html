    <h2>What is "Bryndzové halušky?"</h2>
    <p>
      This is a <strong>Slovak</strong> national dish consisting of potato dumplings (halušky) mixed with
      a creamy, salty sheep's milk cheese (bryndza) and typically topped with
      crispy fried bacon bits. The dish is a hearty and savory comfort food,
      with the tangy cheese coating the soft, doughy dumplings and the bacon
      adding a smoky, salty crunch.
