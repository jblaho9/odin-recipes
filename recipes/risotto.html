    <h2>What is Mushroom Risotto?</h2>
    <p>
      There are all kinds of tasty add-ins to risotto, and mushrooms are just
      one of them. Mushrooms add an earthy, savory flavor to risotto that makes
      it a good complement to main dishes like roast chicken, pork, or beef. You
      can serve mushroom risotto as a side dish, a main dish, or a starter to a
      multi-course Italian menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risotto ranks right up there as one of the greatest dishes you can make
      with rice. Originating in Italy, risotto is a recipe made by simmering a
      starchy variety of rice in broth, with flavor-boosting ingredients added
      like onions, garlic, vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese.

      <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
      <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons
          olive oil in a deep-sided large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add
          sliced portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about
          3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots
          and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated
          with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add
          1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until
          the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite,
          about 15 to 20 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>
          Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter,
          chives, and Parmesan cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</p>
